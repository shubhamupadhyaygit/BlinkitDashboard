🚀 Key Insights from Blinkit Sales Data Analysis 🚀
Leveraging Power BI, I've uncovered some compelling insights into Blinkit's sales performance across various dimensions like fat content, location, outlet size, and item types. Here's a breakdown of the findings:
🍽️ 1. Fat Content Analysis:
•	Low-fat products dominate with total sales of $776K, significantly outperforming regular-fat products at $425K.
•	The highest sales for low-fat products come from Tier 3 locations, contributing a massive $307K (40% of overall low-fat sales). This shows a strong preference for healthier options in less urbanized regions.
•	While low-fat content leads in volume, regular-fat products have higher average sales per product, indicating greater value per item sold.
🌍 2. Location-wise Sales:
•	Tier 3 locations lead with $472.13K in sales, followed by Tier 2 at $393.15K, and Tier 1 at $336.40K. This indicates promising market potential in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions, which could be focal points for expansion.
🏗️ 3. Year-wise Outlet Performance:
•	Outlets established in 2011 show lower sales compared to other years, while those set up in 2018 have the highest sales. This trend suggests that newer outlets, especially those post-2018, are major growth drivers, likely due to better site selection and operational efficiency.
🛒 4. Top-Selling Product Categories:
•	The top 3 sales categories are:
1.	Fruits & Vegetables
2.	Snacks Foods
3.	Household Products
While rankings vary across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations, these three categories consistently dominate across the board.
🏬 5. Outlet Size and Sales:
•	Larger outlets in Tier 3 locations drive significant sales of low-fat products, totaling $98K, compared to $25K in Tier 2. This suggests that larger outlets in less urban regions are key to driving low-fat product sales.
•	Large outlet sizes are notably absent in Tier 1 locations, hinting at a different retail dynamic, where medium and small outlets prevail.
•	In Tier 3, smaller outlets contribute very little to overall sales, while medium outlets maintain a steady presence across all tiers.
